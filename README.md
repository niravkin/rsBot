# rsBot
Objective: The goal of this project is to create a bot that will generate in-game wealth for the game of “Old School” Runescape. 
The market in the Runescape follows many aspects of the real-world market so we manipulate the market in order to make a profit 
through the possible use of real-world strategies. 

DUE TO BOTTING BEING ILLEGAL IN RUNESCAPE, I WILL STRICLY POST MY CODE AND NOT ANY FURTHER REQURED FILES. 
OTHER SCREENSHOTS AND IMAGES ARE REQUIRED TO FULLY RUN THE CODE


In order to tackle our objective, there are different strategies we can implement:
-Creating a Grand Exchange Flipping bot which will analyze the current market for a specified list of items and 
determine which items can be bought for a low price and sold for a higher one.

-RS - In-Depth Beginners Flipping Guide <- READ

-Because we will not be keeping track on updates for the game, we do not have the advantage 
of other merchants of being able to scout items that can be profitable later on

-Most of our investments should be short-term

-Our strategy should be focused on analyzing the buy/sell margins on an item to determine whether or not we can profit from it

-We should cut our losses short, for example, if an item has not sold for an elongated period of time, we should not dwell on that item and the price we have put it at and try to calculate a different price or just move on to another item
